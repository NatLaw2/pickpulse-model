## Sequence 1: Cold Email (3 Touches — Day 1, Day 4, Day 8)

### Touch 1 — Day 1: The Problem + Proof Point

**Subject:** Your pipeline stages aren't probabilities

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: when your reps say a deal is in "Negotiation," what's the actual close probability? Most teams can't answer that — because CRM stages describe process, not likelihood.

We built Predictive Engine OS (PEOS) to fix this. It takes your historical opportunity data and outputs a calibrated close probability for every deal. Calibrated means: if we score 100 deals at 70%, roughly 70 close. We prove it with a calibration chart before go-live.

Typical results: 0.78-0.88 AUC, 2.5-4x lift in the top decile, and a 21-day implementation — not a 6-month project.

Would a 30-minute walkthrough where I show you a scored pipeline sample be useful? Happy to find a time this week or next.

### Touch 2 — Day 4: The Mechanism

**Subject:** Re: Your pipeline stages aren't probabilities

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up briefly. Here's the specific workflow PEOS runs:

1. You export your CRM data (Salesforce, HubSpot, or CSV)
2. We validate the schema and compute derived features (stage velocity, engagement decay, etc.)
3. A gradient-boosted model trains on your historical win/loss outcomes
4. Every open deal gets a 0-100 close probability score
5. We deliver scores via monthly CSV or real-time API

The output is a ranked, scored pipeline your reps actually use — plus AUC, lift, and calibration metrics so you can verify the model works before anyone acts on it.

Setup is $5K-15K depending on tier, monthly is $2K-5K. Live in 21 days.

Worth a conversation?

### Touch 3 — Day 8: The Cost of Inaction

**Subject:** Re: Your pipeline stages aren't probabilities

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Last note on this. Here's the math that usually gets attention:

If your team works 200 opportunities per quarter at $50K average deal size, and your win rate is 25%, that's $2.5M closed. A model that delivers 3x lift in the top decile means your reps' prioritized deals close at 75% instead of 25%. Even shifting 5 additional deals per quarter from loss to win is $250K — against a $24K-60K annual cost for PEOS.

We can run this calculation on your actual pipeline numbers in 30 minutes. If the ROI doesn't pencil out, I'll tell you.

Open to a quick call?

## Sequence 2: LinkedIn DM (3 Touches — Day 1, Day 5, Day 10)

### Touch 1 — Day 1: Connection + Value

> Hi [First Name] — I noticed you lead [sales/CS/RevOps] at [Company]. Quick thought: most CRM pipelines tell you *where* a deal is in the process, but not the actual probability it closes.
>
> We built a scoring engine (PEOS) that outputs calibrated close probabilities for every open deal — typically 0.80+ AUC and 3x lift in the top decile. Takes 21 days to implement.
>
> Would you be open to seeing a scored pipeline sample? Happy to share one that shows how the output looks.

---

### Touch 2 — Day 5: Specific Mechanism

> Hi [First Name] — following up on my note. To be concrete about what PEOS actually does:
>
> You export your opportunity data. We train a model on your historical outcomes. Every deal gets a 0-100 score with three metrics proving accuracy (AUC, lift, calibration).
>
> Delivery is either monthly CSV or real-time API. No new tools to learn — the output plugs into your existing workflow.
>
> Worth 20 minutes to see if your data would produce a useful model?

---

### Touch 3 — Day 10: Soft Close

> Hi [First Name] — last ping on this. If deal prioritization and forecast accuracy aren't pain points right now, totally understand and I'll drop it.
>
> If they are: we can do a 30-minute technical walkthrough where I show you the full workflow — upload, train, evaluate, score — on a sample dataset. You'll see exactly what the output looks like and whether it maps to your use case.
>
> Either way, happy to stay connected.

## Sequence 3: Post-Demo Follow-Up (3 Touches — Day 1, Day 3, Day 7)

### Touch 1 — Day 1 (Same Day as Demo): Recap + Next Step

**Subject:** PEOS walkthrough recap — next steps

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for the time today. Quick recap of what we covered:

**What you saw:**
- Full workflow: data upload, validation, model training, evaluation metrics, scored output, and API response
- [Specific metric from demo, e.g., "AUC of 0.84 on the sample dataset, 3.4x lift in the top decile"]
- Calibration chart showing predicted vs. actual outcomes

**What we discussed:**
- [Module(s) of interest: Sales / Churn / Both]
- [Data source: Salesforce / HubSpot / CSV]
- [Approximate volume: X historical records]
- [Key use case: rep prioritization / forecast accuracy / churn prevention]

**Proposed next step:** [Technical deep-dive with your data team / Data readiness assessment / Security review]

I'll send over the data template so your team can assess field availability. If the fields map cleanly, we can have a trained model on your data within 8 days of receiving the export.

Let me know what works for scheduling the next step.

### Touch 2 — Day 3: Remove Friction

**Subject:** Re: PEOS walkthrough recap — next steps

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Following up on next steps. Two things to make this easy:

1. **Data template attached.** This maps the fields we need to common CRM field names. Most customers can pull this export in under an hour. No PII required — we only need behavioral and transactional fields.

2. **Implementation timeline.** Once we receive data, the clock starts:
   - Day 1-5: Validation and enrichment
   - Day 6-8: Model training and backtesting
   - Day 9-12: Performance review with your team (this is where we show AUC, lift, and calibration on *your* data)
   - Day 13-21: Integration, UAT, go-live

The performance review at Day 9-12 is the decision point. If the model doesn't meet quality standards on your data, we'll tell you — you'll see the metrics yourself.

Is [proposed next step from last email] still the right move? Happy to adjust based on what your team needs.

### Touch 3 — Day 7: Direct Ask

**Subject:** Re: PEOS walkthrough recap — next steps

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Checking in one more time. I want to make sure this doesn't stall if there's interest.

Three possible next steps, in order of commitment:

1. **Low commitment:** Send me a list of the CRM fields you have available. I'll confirm whether we have enough to build a useful model. Takes 5 minutes of your time.

2. **Medium commitment:** Schedule a 30-minute call with your [data/RevOps] team to walk through the data template together and scope the implementation.

3. **Ready to go:** Send us the data export and we start Day 1 of the 21-day implementation.

If the timing isn't right, that's fine too — just let me know and I'll follow up next quarter.

What makes sense?

PickPulse is a purpose-built churn prediction platform for B2B SaaS companies. It turns your account data into ranked risk scores, actionable insights, and measurable revenue protection.

- **Account-Level Churn Probabilities** — Know which customers are at risk, with confidence intervals calibrated to your business.
- **Urgency Scoring & ARR at Risk** — Prioritize outreach based on renewal proximity and revenue exposure.
- **Revenue Recovery Simulation** — Model projected recoverable ARR at assumed save rates across risk tiers.
- **Executive Dashboards & Exports** — PDF reports, CSV downloads, REST API access. Built for operators and executives alike.

## 3. How It Works

### Step 1: Connect
Ingest account data from your CRM, billing system, product analytics, and support platforms. ARR, renewal dates, usage signals, support tickets, and more.

### Step 2: Train
PickPulse trains a gradient-boosted model specific to {{Client Name}}'s data. The model is calibrated to produce accurate probabilities, not just rankings.

### Step 3: Act
Access churn predictions through dashboards, scheduled reports, or API. Filter by risk tier, urgency, or ARR exposure. Export cohorts for targeted campaigns. Measure lift against random targeting.

## 4. Modules

### Churn Risk Engine
The core module. Produces account-level churn probabilities, risk tiers (High/Medium/Low), and urgency scores. Includes:

- **Risk Tier Breakdown** — Accounts segmented by churn likelihood. See counts, total ARR at risk, and projected recoverable revenue.
- **Lift Analysis** — Compare model performance to random targeting. Understand how much better PickPulse is at surfacing real risk.
- **Feature Attribution** — Understand which signals drive churn risk for specific accounts (low usage, support volume, contract size, etc.).
- **Historical Validation** — Backtest predictions against actual churn to validate accuracy and calibration over time.

### Coming Soon
- **Expansion Opportunity Scoring** — Identify upsell and cross-sell candidates.
- **Health Score Monitoring** — Continuous account health tracking with trend alerts.
- **Campaign Impact Attribution** — Measure save-rate lift from targeted interventions.

## 5. Why PickPulse

### Purpose-Built for Churn Prediction
Generic BI tools show you what happened. PickPulse tells you what will happen—and how to prevent it.

### Calibrated Probabilities, Not Just Rankings
Most models produce risk scores that mean nothing on their own. PickPulse outputs true probabilities: a 70% churn risk means 7 in 10 similar accounts will churn.

### Custom-Trained on Your Data
No off-the-shelf models. PickPulse trains on {{Client Name}}'s account history, cohort dynamics, and business-specific signals. The model learns what churn looks like for you.

### Revenue-First Metrics
Every dashboard and export prioritizes ARR impact. Filter by dollars at risk, not just headcount. Model recovery scenarios based on realistic save rates.

### Built for Operators, Trusted by Executives
Fast enough for CSMs to act daily. Rigorous enough for board decks. Export PDF reports, schedule email digests, or integrate via REST API.

## 6. FAQ

### How secure is our data?
All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. PickPulse operates in SOC 2 Type II compliant infrastructure. Customer data is never shared across tenants or used to train models outside your instance.

### How long does onboarding take?
Most customers are live within 2 weeks. Data ingestion and model training are automated. {{Client Name}} provides access to source systems; PickPulse handles schema mapping, feature engineering, and validation.

### How accurate are the predictions?
Accuracy depends on data quality and churn base rate. Typical deployments achieve AUC-ROC scores above 0.80, with calibration error under 5%. We provide historical backtests to validate performance before launch.

### What integrations do you support?
PickPulse connects to Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, ChartMogul, Segment, Zendesk, Intercom, and any database or warehouse via JDBC/ODBC. Custom integrations available.

### Do we need a data team to use this?
No. PickPulse handles feature engineering, model training, and calibration automatically. If you have a data warehouse, we can connect directly. If not, we'll work with your existing SaaS tools.

### What if our churn patterns change?
PickPulse retrains models on a regular cadence (monthly or quarterly) to adapt to evolving cohort behavior, product changes, and seasonal dynamics.

### How is this different from a health score?
Health scores are typically weighted averages of usage metrics. PickPulse trains a supervised model on actual churn outcomes, using hundreds of features across multiple data sources. It predicts probability, not sentiment.

### Can we export predictions into our CRM?
Yes. PickPulse provides a REST API and scheduled CSV exports. Most customers sync churn scores and risk tiers directly into Salesforce or HubSpot for CSM workflows.
